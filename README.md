# 4sh
A shell way too minimal that u might cant say its bloated.

# compiling
just run ``make`` or use most basic gcc command ever lol

dedicated for the people who say everything is bloated <3
includes history and a obvious copy of bashrc called 4shrc

# installing
after running make, just do
make install (needs root))
